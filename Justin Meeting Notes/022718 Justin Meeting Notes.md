## 022718 Justin Meeting Ntes

* Main goal of meeting with Justin today is to make sure that the research stories that we are doing (UX Audit) is correct
* Some questions to consider: 
    * What are they trying to do on this website? 
    * You are a filmmaker. You have to answer what this person is doing before you can simulate what they’re doing
    * Note what is confusing. Note maybe how to start search from scratch? 
    * Can you restrict the search in some ways?

* Comments on some of the UX presented
    * Vanessa’s UX Audit is fine but also could improve. Also think “What does the screen have/do?” 
    * Jonathan’s scenario UX audit is good (maybe do this instead of the others?)
    
    
* Things to do
    * Flush out one of the user stories you’re working on. 
    * Create scenario 
    * Choose one scary to flush out and send to Yusef (along with time estimation)
