## Teachers User Experience Audit

#### User Story
###### K–12 Teacher
Black woman (from Ethiopia), mid-20s, single. Went through UCLA Teacher Education Program, taught at John Muir Middle School across from Library. Not from the neighborhoods she’s teaching in but very involved in the life of her students, beyond school hours. Had special after-school projects, meetings with them. Frustrated by school administration/entrenched teachers at her middle school. Saw Library as sanctuary, used it for meetings w/ other teachers to renew themselves, also used it as space for her extracurricular projects w/ students. Left public school system to work at social justice charter school, where she could have more say. Hasn’t used Library’s collections. Wants to use our resources (Foundation Center, booksale) but doesn’t make it down. Very busy; spends much of her time focused on her work, in conjunction w/ likeminded friends (works collectively). Does yoga.
