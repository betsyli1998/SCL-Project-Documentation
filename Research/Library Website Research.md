## 1/30/18 Research

* Common Essential Features of Multiple Library Websites
    * Events/News sectioned by students, faculty/staff, research, etc.
    * Slideshow with Banners
    * Catalog/Suggested Reads/Search Bar
    * Misc (Donate, Social Media, Review, Help/FAQ)
    * CMS (Search categorized by books/articles/journal/etc)

* Website Designs to Consider
    * Menu that stays on screen as you scroll is nice
    * Header that doesn't take up entire screen
    * Catalog search field should not be directly in top left corner (saw a website designed with it there and it was not intuitive to look there for it - here's a link https://gyazo.com/66456dabaa8a86b553bc21cda92005d4)
    * Same or separate site for catalog? Think same is better

* Detailed Descriptions
    * Los Angeles Public Library (http://www.lapl.org/)
        * Includes a lot of branches...Eagle Rock, Arroyo Seco, Cypress Park, Silver Lake...
