## 02/13/18 Library Sites
* https://www.salinaspubliclibrary.org/
    * Like the option of catalog versus site search in search bar. Don't like the lack of boxes around the various options/buttons. Blue outline when in that option is weird.
    * Like the 3 options in top right corner but then pratt makes it look better with the images
    * The site is for multiple libraries so can't really compare rest of design because it's focused on showing what libraries are part of the group
* http://www.prattlibrary.org/
    * Similar things as above
    * Think having a search bar be in the top is better than having a button that links to the search bar page. Less work.
    * Has a clear search bar for their catalog on the home page - easy to access if you just loaded onto their site
    * Having the headings for their sections makes it clear what each section is about for their various posts in the section, but the posts take up too much vertical space I think. Maybe if all the posts showed was the picture/title of the post and if you hovered over it, you could view some more details it would be better.
* https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/
    * Mentioned this site because they have some materials for learning
    * Upcoming events clear and being near the top makes it more visible
    * Also was thinking of combining their header/top section with other sites (when users click on something like search, a search bar will appear - unless we have the search bar present by default)
* https://cmpl.org/
    * Focuses on the catalog by putting it in the middle of the home page
    * Easy-access to services and information on the top
    * Has "new to the library"; this can be the spotlight feature
    * Upcoming events section
    * User-friendly and clean design
* https://www.nypl.org/
    * Another cleanly designed site
    * This site definitely has a lot more going on than SCL does but the way the information is arranged is very organized and easy to navigate
