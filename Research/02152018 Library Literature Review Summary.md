Summary:
* Important elements of website design: navigation, graphics, organization, content utility, purpose, simplicity, and readability -- links, interactive features, and consistency also important
* Common problem is clutter - ex., browsable hierarchies in addition to a search function
    * Focus more on the speed of the website
    * Try to have left most item on menu be free of excess content and make it the most usable site
    * Fewer menu items (3-4), no hamburger menu for mobile sites
    * Can do "duotones" to make colored images less distracting
    * Have a search bar visible near the top left below the menu (http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/)
* Have samples of different kinds of resources - would be like a featured list
* For different buttons or links, have material design (https://econsultancy.com/blog/65966-what-is-material-design-10-pioneering-examples/). Basically simple representations of the main idea of each button.
