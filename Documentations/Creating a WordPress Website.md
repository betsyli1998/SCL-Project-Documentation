# Creating a WordPress Website

### Introduction
This is a how-to guide that goes through the steps taken to create the WordPress page that is being used as a prototype currently. It is important to note that there are multiple ways of achieving the same result. The method discussed in this guide is one of the simple methods that one can take in creating a WordPress page.

### Creating an Account for Hosting Site
First, it is important to set up a hosting site. The host used for the prototype is [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/) which is one of the many free hosting sites available. When you get to the site, there should be a Free Sign Up button either in the middle of the page or the top right corner of the page. Using your email, sign up for a free account.

After you have signed up for an account, check your email for a confirmation email. You must confirm before creating a website. When you click on the *Verify email* button in your email, it will take you back to 000webhost where an Email verified! message will appear.

### Starting a WordPress Site
On the top left corner of the page you're currently on, there is a *Build website* button with a picture icon. Click on it. This will then take you to a page with three big buttons in the middle: *Build a Website Easily*, *Build WordPress Website*, and *Upload Own Website*. Click on the *Build WordPress Website*. A pop-up will appear with the *WordPress install* header. Fill out the required information and press *Install*. 000webhost will then automatically create a WordPress site for you which you can view right away.

### Afterwards
* How do I access the Admin page for my WordPress site?
    * To access the admin page for the WordPress website, include */wp-admin* to the end of your URL (e.g. operationscl.000webhostapp.com/wp-admin) and log in using the admin login and password you set during the *WordPress install* popup.
* My website is down! What do I do?
    * Because 000webhost is a free hosting site, there are times when your website will be unavailable due to the free service. In addition, it is important to note that for all the sites created using a free account, **there is an hour in which the website will go down.** However, you can set when the website will go down through 000webhost.
