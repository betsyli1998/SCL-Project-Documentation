## 02/23/18 Sprint Retro Spective Meeting
**1.	What went well?**

Putting due dates on tasks and using trello more often.

**2.	What didn't go well?**

Communication between the team and the staff of SCL still need to be improved.

**3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?**

We learned to communicate with team members as soon as there seems like something could be a bloop

**4.	What should we do differently next time?**

N/A

**5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?**

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are still researching, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. We will hopefully figure out soon.
