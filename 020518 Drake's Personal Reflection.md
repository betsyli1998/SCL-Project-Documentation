## 2/5/18 Drake's Personal Reflection

#### Project Description
Operation SCL's main goal is to increase the accessibility of the materials
in the archive of Southern California Library. In order to do this, SCL has
asked us to create a system that would allow for them to easily upload the
materials they have in their archive to their online website. While doing so,
they also want to revamp their online website by including the said system above
and some popular features that many libraries use on their websites. These
features are to be determined by us after conducting a quick research.

#### Initial Thoughts
The project description from the first day of class describes this project pretty
well in my opinion. My expectation from the beginning and now are similar in the
way that the main goal of the project is described perfectly by the project
description shown in class. The meeting with the community partner did definitely
add onto the list of tasks as we have to look for more features to incorporate
into SCL's new website. This process is definitely going to take some back-and-forth
to determine which features to keep and which features to discard.

#### Current State
I am feeling pretty good about the project. We created a mock WordPress site to
test out plugins and become familiar with WordPress in general. There are already
numerous plugins available through WordPress that we can utilize for most of the
request features (with some minor tweaks). I also found some open source
catalog system we can use as back up if there are no plugins that we can use. I
think we are on the right track in terms of schedule. Since it is still the
beginning, I think it's going to take a bit more for everyone to get used to the
environments we would be playing with but once the ball gets rolling, I have a
good feeling that we will be able to create a satisfactory working product.
