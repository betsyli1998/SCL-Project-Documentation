## 1/31/18 Justin Meeting Notes

* Create a table of plugins and their features so we can compare them easily
* Not everything has to be a feature
* Create a working functionality prototype before going to SCL
* Check out Disqus plugin for commenting/discussing system
* Important to create documentation/tutorial/instructions as we go along
* Focus on the basic/mandatory features first before going into anything else
