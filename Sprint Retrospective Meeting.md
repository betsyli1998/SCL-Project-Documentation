1.	What went well?

We created a functioning prototype and found some good plug-ins that we could use for the catalog. 

2.	What didn't go well? 

Communication between the team and the community partner wasn't the fastest and thus it resulted in some impediment. 

3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?

We learned as a group that everyone needs to do what he or she was assigned to do. Because if one person slacks off, the team is weighed down because every task is interconnected. 

4.	What should we do differently next time? 

Divide up tasks more quantitatively and set deadlines. Instead of vaguely saying "think of questions" the task should be more of "post two questions before Monday". 

5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are still researching, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. We will hopefully figure out soon.
