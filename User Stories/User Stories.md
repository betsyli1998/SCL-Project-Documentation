## User Stories

#### SCL Staff
As a staff member at SCL, I want easily upload files/archives and create content online so that visitors can access/request our archives and read our content.

#### Researcher
A Researcher's main goal is to quickly access the catalog for documents/information he/she requires. A Researcher will have a topic in mind and using the keywords related to that topic, the Researcher will go through the catalog in finding related materials. It will be preferred for the Researcher to access these materials online but if not, a Researcher would probably like to either request these materials to be sent, look at information regarding visiting SCL, or any ways of contacting staffs of SCL.

#### Student
As a middle school student, I want to be able to learn more about volunteering opportunities as well as interesting books I might want to read. An easily accessible list of upcoming volunteer events and descriptions would help, as well as a list of books that people like me like to read.

#### Teacher
As a teacher who works at the middle school not far from SCL, I would like to maximize the things I could do at SCL. This includes the resources Foundation center, book sale, room reservation. Sometimes I might be frustrated by the school administration because of various reasons that center around its inability to provide for my students. However, I am able to use the library as a space for extracurricular projects with students to teach them history and social justice. I am well-trained through the UCLA Teacher Education Program and young enough to navigate my way through the internet without instructions.
