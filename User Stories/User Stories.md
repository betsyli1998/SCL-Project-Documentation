#### SCL Staff
As a staff member at SCL, I want easily upload files/archives and create content online so that visitors can access/request our archives and read our content.

#### Researcher
A Researcher's main goal is to quickly access the catalog for documents/information he/she requires. A Researcher will have a topic in mind and using the keywords related to that topic, the Researcher will go through the catalog in finding related materials. It will be preferred for the Researcher to access these materials online but if not, a Researcher would probably like to either request these materials to be sent, look at information regarding visiting SCL, or any ways of contacting staffs of SCL.
