The mission statement of Operation SCL is to design an effective catalogue system and re-construct a more user-friendly 
website for Southern California Library. The library is limited in many ways. It only has two staffs that are not tech-savvy;
as a non-profit organization it does not have as much funding as they would like to do things such as organizing all the 
resources they have. The goal essentially is to design the website so that the staffs can update it to their accordance 
(preferably with a little training), the people who use the libraryâ€™s resources can maneuver the website more easily, 
and create an effective system for the library to update and record what they have online. 

Initially I thought the project was just revamping a website due to its lack of design; however, meeting with Yusef shifted 
the focus of the project from that to creating an online archive that the library can use to put all the information they have
in the library online. I think the project is going well so far, I am looking forward to actually seeing the amount of files
that the library has that Yusef is expecting to put online. I think one concern I do have is team cooperation. Currently everyone on the team is supposedly doing research on how other libraries organize their information so that we can have a model for what we will design for SCL.
