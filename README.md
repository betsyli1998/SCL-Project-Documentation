Re-design/re-architect Southern California Library's website using a content
management system potentially integrating book circulation/catalog services.

###### Initial Question:
* What is the main goal of the new website?
    * To relay information about library? To have an online catalog?
    * Mandatory features? Features you would like to see implemented?
* How is the current website and catalog kept?
    * Obtain access to current files, docs, or images
* Who are the users? How much traffic/server load?
* Any specific CMS?
    * Barcode? Manually input each article in system?
* Any type of security? Regular maintenance or updates?
    * Preferences for post-project maintenance

###### Community Person Meeting Notes (1/29)
* Want us to start with doing research about other websites and what works;
goal is to make a survey to send out to people; show to community partner
before distributing
* More features like exhibits, content management system, switching to WordPress
    * Features to integrate: search request form, donor option (they do have
        it), digitized packets, space rentals, volunteer
* Check out other libraries, survey features, improve accessibility, what
features users would like
* Access documents/international reach (people come from all over the world to
    access the documents in the library/lots of social justice documents/social
    implications), change out documents available online according to demand
* Limited staffs, limited in terms of technological knowledge, limited ability
to organize archives so editing and uploading should be made easy
* Analytics
* Rate/review/comment
* No static document (mix of resources)
* Key audiences (researchers, high school students, undergrad, faculty) and
what they want or need
    * User membership (volunteers, learners, researchers)
* Figure out what platforms to use
* Important websites for research:
    * https://omeka.org/
    * http://www.oac.cdlib.org/
* Questions to consider when designing the website:
    * The social implications behind it
    * How to improve the libraryâ€™s accessibility to the public (local, national,
        and international)
    * How to appeal to different audiences (different age groups/target audience)
