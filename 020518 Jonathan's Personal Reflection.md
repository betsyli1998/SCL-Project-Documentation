Jonathan’s Thought:

	The project’s main focus is redesigning and restructuring Southern California Library’s website to include a easy and effective method of cataloging and uploading materials such as archives. The first phase of the project includes researching numerous library websites and determining what features are working as well as creating a MVP of a functioning Wordpress site that can upload archives and files. The second phase of this project includes creating a more friendly UI for the staff to consistently upload content without confusion or complications as well as a working sort, filter, and search option. In this phase, the website should have all necessary and working features such as a donate option, contact/request forms, events, and so on. 

	I thought our project was going to be very coding based which included the heavy use of html and css. The meeting with our community member changed my understanding of the project because there was more of an emphasis on the content management system rather than the interface and design. I am very excited and looking forward to learning about how to utilize and implement a CMS into the website, a feat that I have not yet done. I am confident in our team and their skills to complete this project. I know that there will be times when unexpected roadblocks will occur but I believe that my group will eventually figure out a solution.
