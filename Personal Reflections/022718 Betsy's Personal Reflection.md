**Reflect on the agile/scrum process. What are its started goals? Based on your project so far, is that process 
achieving those goals for your team? Why/Why not?**
  The major goals include dividing up tasks more efficiently and quantitatively, adapting another form of research method that was different from what we originally were doing. Based on the project, the process we are adapting is achieving the goal (or at least now . It is efficient until the next update with our community partner. 
        
**Reflect on your communication with your community partner. Do you think you are on the same page? Why/why not?**
        I think we have been not on the same page with our community partner. There are a lot of factors that cause it include difference in expectation, and different levels of understanding in terms of programming and actual implementation. Also a lack of physical communication could be another reason why there is miscommunication. 
  
**Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?**
        I think my anxiety has shifted to fear because there has been speculation about the possibility of the project getting dropped by our community partner. Also I know there is a number of projects provided by Oxy's Open Source Club which we might be able to work on. Hopefully the project continues and we don't have any other impediment.
