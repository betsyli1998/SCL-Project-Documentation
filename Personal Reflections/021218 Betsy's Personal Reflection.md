**What tasks did your team set out to complete this past sprint? What did you actually complete? If they are not the same, 
what are the sources of this discrepancy?**

The original goals of the last sprint were to find catalog plug-ins and become more familiar with using WordPress. In other
words, researching was the focus. I think these two main tasks were completed by everyone. However, Yusef's response introduced
us to another aspect that we have not really considered which is user survey. So, although this might be a source of 
discrepancy, it is still a part of our research process. 
  
**What tasks will your team complete this coming sprint? How did you decide on these priorities?**

I think we will be focusing immensely on conducting user experience surveys because that is what Yusef wants. On the side,
we will be researching library websites in terms of their design. By creating an assessment template, we will rate library 
sites on a scale of 1-5 stars in different aspects. At the end of the sprint, hopefully we would have finalized the catalog 
plug-in we want to use. 

**How accurate were your estimates of the community partner's priorities, based on your initial meeting and then the 
subsequent email follow-ups?**

I think there was a gap between our understanding of research. Yusef wanted us to collect data regarding user experience 
while we were thinking of researching other sites and such. However, I think we are slowly understanding SCL's priorities as
of now. 

**Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?**

I think I am a bit more certain about the project than I was during my last personal reflection. I wouldn't call what I 
feel now as fear but rather just anxiety from the uncertainty as to how much collecting user surveys would impact the
tentative plan we have right now. Hopefully, we can physically see the library's collection soon and meet with them in person
to discuss these matters.
