## 2/27/18 Drake's Personal Reflection

#### Reflect on the agile/scrum process. What are it's started goals? Based on your project so far, is that process achieving those goals for your team? Why/Why not?

Because the focus of our project has been shifted multiple times with many of our works being put off until later, the scrum process for our group has been a bit shaky. As the focus of each sprint constantly changes, it has been difficult to work towards achieving a certain goal. Our process has been more of just focusing on tasks rather than the overall goal since we don't even know if the tasks we're doing are correctly done. However, one thing that has been working great is the scrum meeting. Because our focus changes constantly as we receive feedback about our work, meeting regularly helps us to reorganize and refocus our work.

#### Reflect on your communication with your community partner. Do you think you are on the same page? Why/why not?

We have definitely not been on the same page but hopefully with the most recent communication, that is improving. It is my understanding that our community partner does not utilize technology frequently (i.e. does not check emails on a daily basis).
It is also understood that they are very busy with what they have going on in the library. Sending terse emails initially definitely did not help to build a relationship with the community partner that would have lead to maybe better communication with them.

#### Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?

Still don't feel confident about this project. At this point, I feel like we're going to be spending the entire semester researching other libraries. I also wished to have some coding done but I feel like that would not happen unless we decide to make a plugin or something. I do have some hopes though now that we might actually be doing something that the community partner wants us to do. Hopefully we can make some progress for this project.
