## 2/12/18 Drake's Reflection

#### What tasks did your team set out to complete this past sprint? What did you actually complete? If they are not the same, what are the sources of this discrepancy?
When we started, we wanted to focus on research and creating a prototype that we can play around with. We did make a prototype that we are constantly playing with in terms of testing out plugins for features. For research, we did conduct some basic research by checking out other libraries' websites and some online archives. It wasn't until towards the end of the sprint when our community partner replied to our first email with requests on how to conduct the research.

#### What tasks will your team complete this coming sprint? How did you decide on these priorities?
For this sprint, we will focus mostly on research/survey. We decided on this because our community partner put heavy emphasis on this process through the communication.

#### How accurate were your estimates of the community partner's priorities, based on your initial meeting and then the subsequent email followups?
We were a bit off in terms of estimates. We didn't put too much emphasis on research/survey. Initially, we were going to check out similar library websites and archives and see which features work and which don't. And for the survey, we were planning on having some quick conversations with fellow friends, students, and researchers in terms of what they would like to see in a library/archive website and what they would not like to see. From the reply sent by our community partner, we realized that we need to put more focus on the research phase for this project.

#### Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
I definitely don't feel as confident as I did in the beginning. There is definitely a lot of pressure on the research phase of the project but I feel like we are not going to find out much about what features we need to implement other than what we already know/what SCL already has and has requested. In addition, there are certain features that our community partner has requested which may be out of scope such as the implementation of a learning system within the site (e.g. moodle).
